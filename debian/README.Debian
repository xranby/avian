avian for Debian
----------------

This package is built to use the OpenJDK class library.  To use
the Avian runtime, start java with the option -avian, like:

	java -avian -version

When backporting the package, please make sure that the jvm.cfg for
OpenJDK 7 has the line

	-avian KNOWN

at the end of the configuration file (without leading whitespace).
