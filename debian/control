Description: lightweight virtual machine using the OpenJDK class library
 Avian is a lightweight virtual machine and class library designed
 to provide a useful subset of Java's features, suitable for building
 self-contained applications.
 .
 The VM is implemented from scratch and designed to be both fast and small.
 .
  - Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for fast method execution.
  - Generational, copying garbage collection ensures short pause times and good
    spatial locality.
  - Thread-local heaps provide O(1) memory allocation with no synchronization
    overhead.
  - Null pointer dereferences are handled via OS signals to avoid unnecessary
    branches.
